    "\n",
    "See the Flask docs for the full list of incoming request data. To provide an example, each description includes an example value for a request hitting http://localhost:5000/tuple/abc?foo=bar&foo=baz\n",
    "\n",
    "* **endpoint**:  specifies the name of the request endpoint routed, for example, return_string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **method**: specifies the HTTP method of the current request, for example, GET.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **view_args**:  specifies the dict of arguments parsed from URL route rule, for example,{'resource': u'abc'}.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **args**:  specifies the dict of arguments parsed from the URL query string, for example, request.args['foo'] is 'bar' and request.args.getlist('foo') is ['bar', 'baz'].\n",
    "\n",
    "* **form**: This feature of the request object specifies the dict of form data from POST or PUT requests, for example, {}.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **user_agent**: This feature of the request object specifies the version identification provided by the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **files**: This feature of the request object specifies the dict of file uploads from POST or PUT requests, which go here instead of request.form, for example, {}. Each value in the dict is a FileStorage object which behaves like a Python file object, but also includes a save(filepath) method to store uploaded files (after you validate the destination path).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **is_xhr**: True: This feature of the request object specifies when the incoming request is a JavaScript XMLHttpRequest, and False otherwise. This works with JavaScript libraries that provide the X-Requested-With HTTP header, set to XMLHttpRequest\n",
    "\n",
    "Flask uses a custom dict type ImmutableMultiDict which supports multiple values per key (accessed by the getlist method), in cases where HTTP allows multiple values for a given argument, such as the query string in the URL, for example, ?foo=bar&foo=baz.\n",

    "Heroku was one of the first platform as a service providers. It started as a hosting option for Ruby based applications, but then grew to support many other languages like Java, Node.js and our favorite, Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, deploying a web application to Heroku requires just uploading the application using git. Heroku looks for a file called Procfile in the application's root directory for instructions on how to execute the application. For Python projects Heroku also expects a requirements.txt file that lists all the module dependencies that need to be installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating Heroku account\n",

    "Once you are logged in you have access to a dashboard, where all your apps can be managed. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Installing the Heroku client\n",
    "\n",
    "Heroku offers a tool called the \"Heroku client\" that we'll use to create and manage our application. This tool is available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. If there is a [Heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) download for your platform then that's the easiest way to get the Heroku client tool installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we should do with the client tool is to login to our account:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ heroku login\n",
    "    \n",
    "To deploy to Heroku the application must be in a local git repository. If your code is in Github, clone it first. Remember to checkout the \n",

    "We know the Flask web server is not good for production use because it is single process and single threaded, so we need a better server. The Heroku tutorial for Python suggests `gunicorn`, a pre-fork style web server written in Python, so that's the one we'll use.\n",
